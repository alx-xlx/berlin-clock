Demo - 



The Berlin Clock consists of 24 lights which are divided into one circular blinking Yellow Light on top to denote the Seconds, Two top rows denoting the Hours and two bottom rows denoting the Minutes.

The clock is read from the top row to the bottom. The top row of 4 red fields denote 5 full hours each, alongside the second row, also of 4 red fields, which denote one full hour each, displaying the hour value in 24-hour format. The third row consists of eleven yellow-and-red fields, which denote 5 full minutes each (the red ones also denoting 15, 30 and 45 minutes past), and the bottom row has another 4 yellow fields, which mark one full minute each. The round yellow light on top blinks to denote odd (when lit) or even-numbered (when unlit) seconds.
